//! puke
//!
//! a **very** early-stage language with a focus on:
//!
//! * the terseness of erlang/prolog
//! * first-class fault injection, simulation and model-based testing capabilities
//! * built-in data structures
//! * high quality scheduling built from the beginning to play well with io_uring and iocp
